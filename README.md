# Visualisation of University Courses

## Overview

Each year the schools within the university provide courses for their students. Every year these change and are displayed online. However, it can be difficult for students and staff to get the full picture of the courses and how they relate to each other (e.g. through prerequisites and course learning objectives).

This project will develop a tool to display a set of courses in a graphical form that will make it easier to gain an understanding of the courses and their prerequisites to plan a degree programme.

The project is live on [VUWVISUAL](https://vuwvisual.herokuapp.com/)
